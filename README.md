# Demo iOS App using MVVM-C, SwiftUI, and Combine

## Description

This is a demo iOS application built to showcase the MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator) design pattern. The app is developed using SwiftUI and the Combine framework, demonstrating modern iOS development practices with a clean and maintainable architecture.

## Features

- **MVVM-C Architecture:** Implements the Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator design pattern for separation of concerns and scalability.
- **SwiftUI:** Utilizes Apple's declarative UI framework to build user interfaces.
- **Combine:** Uses reactive programming to handle asynchronous events and data flows.

## Installation

To get started with this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/WajihBenabdessalem/MVVM-C_SwiftUI_Combine.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd MVVM-C_SwiftUI_Combine
    ```

3. **Open the project in Xcode:**
    ```bash
    open MVVM-C_SwiftUI_Combine.xcodeproj
    ```

4. **Build and run the project:**
    - Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode.
    - Select the desired target (simulator or device).
    - Press the Run button or use `Cmd + R` to build and run the app.

## Usage

1. **Launch the App:** Run the app on your iOS device or simulator.
2. **Explore Features:** Navigate through the app to see the MVVM-C architecture in action.
3. **Review the Code:** Examine the `Model`, `View`, `ViewModel`, and `Coordinator` components to understand how the architecture is implemented.

### MVVM-C Architecture Overview

- **Model:** Handles data and business logic.
- **View:** Manages the user interface and displays data.
- **ViewModel:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, managing state and logic.
- **Coordinator:** Manages navigation and flow within the app.

For a more detailed explanation of the architecture, check out the [Architecture Guide](link-to-architecture-guide).
